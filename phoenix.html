      <p class="about-information">Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor. <br> According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, <br> although there are other sources that claim that the legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again. <br> There are different traditions concerning the lifespan of the phoenix, but by most accounts the phoenix lived for 500 years before rebirth.</p>
